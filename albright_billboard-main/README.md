# albright_billboard
Write me two python files with each having their own classes which are:
- Billboard
- Design
The Billboard class will be the main class. The billboard class will have a property called "designs" that holds a list of Design class instances. The Billboard class will have the run function that runs the program. The Billboard class will have the change_design function that cycles through the design list property on the self. The design class is a class that holds the design of the billboard class that will be visually shown on screen. The design class should have a delay integer variable that adds a delay to the billboard class change_design function. 
Use the pygame library to show the results in a visual format.
